Tfflr play is preserved to us in two MSS, one (C) belonging
to Caius College, Cambridge1, the other (J) to St John's College,
Cambridge& Churchill and Keller³ are probably right in dating
the Caius MS at least before 1600 and in assigning the other to
the years 1630-35. In both manuscripts the title of the play,
if there ever was one, is lacking. One might suggest ‘Erophilus’
or ‘Mortuus redivivus.' From the accident however that the
Prologue is delivered by the god Hymenaeus, whose name
therefore heads the text as we have it, the play has been
referred to by this name by all who have had to do with it,
and it is practically convenient to keep the name in this edition.

Neither MS gives any direct information as to the author·
ship of the play, or the date or place of its production.
Fortunately however J gives a list of the performers‚ and from
this it is clear that the play was acted at St John’s College,
