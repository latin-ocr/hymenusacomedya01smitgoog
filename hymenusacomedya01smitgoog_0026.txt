xvi INTRODUCTION

III. Hns Tua ΡιΑΥ nasu pampro narona?

Messrs Churchill and Keller write: ‘Hymenaeus wurde
auch 1631 (l) gedruckt: das British Museum besitzt kein
Exemplar. Halliwell und Fleay erwahnen den Druck gar
nicht. Leider habe ich das Buch auch nicht gesehen.'

I am not aware what was the authority for the statement
that the play had been printed. It is, I imagine, incorrect.
Ι have come across no trace of the printed play in the Stationers'
Registers nor in the catalogues of great libraries. I incline to
think that the original statement must have tested on some
confusion between this play (which, if printed, would almost
certainly have had a different title) and Jonson's masque

Hymenaei, which was printed in 1606. Professor Keller has
kindly written to me to say that he thinks this explanation not
improbable. Or the confusion may have been with the collec-
tion of Cambridge verses on the marriage of the Princess Anne
to Prince George of Denmark published in 1683 under the
title Hymenaeus Cantabrigiensis.
