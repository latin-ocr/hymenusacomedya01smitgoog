became Β.Α. together in March 1573. But if the per-
formance took place at the Bachelors’ Commencement (we
know that Richardus III was performed at St John’s at the
Bachelors’ Commencement of the following year), the incon-
sistency is easy to understand.

A greater difficulty is presented by the cases of Punter and
Rockley, who, if rightly identified, had become Β.Α. two years
previously, but are not credited with the title in this list.
However, the omission of a degree is a more likely mistake
than the attribution of a degree to one not entitled to it: and
we may conclude that the evidence on the whole points to the
play having been produced at the Bachelors' Commencement
of 1573. The date is confirmed hyan entry in the College
Accounts of the third quarter (March 25—June 21) of the
year 1578-1579: ‘Layde out about the playes in diverse
vses...xxxv¹¹1.'’

The author of the play was probably one of the original
actors: perhaps Mr Hickman who played the ‘hero,’ or
Abraham Fraunce, whom we know as the author of the Latin
play Wctoria, which was perhaps acted at St John’s this very
year.

¹ Messrs Churchill and Keller have fallen into some slight errore, first
by treating ‘D’ as meaning Doctor, and imagining that Doctors of the
University would take part with undergraduates in performing a play, and
seeondly by not having obtained access to the lists of graduates of the
University preserved in the Registry and transcribed in the Baker MSS in
the University Library. While they notice that the actors are mostly the
sameas those that took part in aeting Richardur Tertius in March 1553,
they do not see that the differences in the lists indicate that Hymenaeus was
acted a year earlier than Legge's tragedy.
