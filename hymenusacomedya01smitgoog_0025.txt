INTRODUCTION xv

The drunken character of the German was of course a common-
place in Elizabethan England.

The action of the play covers something less than 24 hours.
It extends from the middle of one day to the morning of the
next.

The scene is unchanged. It must have shown three houses
-those of Alphonsus, Lucius (father of Camillus), and the
Innkeeper1. From one or other of these houses the characters
came out into the street, the scene of the action. From the
fact that the College seems to have spent {35 (in our money,
say 75200) on the plays of the year (probably not more than
two), it is clear that the stage-machinery and the dresses of the
actors left nothing to be desired.

The language of the play is based on that of Plautus and
Terence, from whom, as will be seen in the notes, considerable
borrowings are made. It naturally however contains words not
known to Latin comedy, and those solecisms of construction
and form which are characteristic of Latin writers of the 16th

century.
