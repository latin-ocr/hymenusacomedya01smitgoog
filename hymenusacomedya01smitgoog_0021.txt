The source'of the play is acknowledged by the author in
his Prologus to be Boccaccio’s Decomerone. More specifically,

it is the loth story of the Fourth Day¹. It is not necessary to
reproduce the story here, sufficient to say that our author
treats it with great freedom, while retaining with much skill
points in it which lend themselves to dramatic effect.

In place of the adulterous wife and her paramour, he gives
a girl, Julia, and her wooer, Erophilus. The girl's father,
Alphonsus, takes the place of the original husband, but he loses
the medical character of the latter², which is transferred to one
of two new characters, comic rivals of Erophilus for Julia's love,
a vainglorious doctor, Pantomagus, and a drunken German,
F redericus. Every wooer is provided with a confidant in the
shape ofa servant (Erophilus has also a friend, Camillus), while
Julia has one in her maid Amerina. ln place of Boccaccio’s
two usurers, we have two highwaymen and their accomplice,
an innkeeper. After an ingeniously worked out intrigue, comes
a more satisfactory denotlment than was possible in Boccaccio's

1 The same story of Boccaccio is combined with another (the 6th story
of the Ninth Day) in the Spanish El Menandro by Matias de los Reyes‚
printed in 1636. See Miss C. B. Bourland's Bryn Mawr thesis, Boccaccio
and the Decamrron in Cartilian and Catalan Litcrature (1905), p. 114. It
is a pity that the after-history of the Decamcronc in other modern literatures
than Spanish has not been worked out in Miss Bourland’s manner.

² Itis suggested by D. Μ. Manui, istoria dcl Decamcrone (1742), that
Boccaccio’s ‘Mazaeo’ is to be identified with Matthaeus Silvaticus, whose
Pandectae Medicinae was printed at Venice in 1480.
