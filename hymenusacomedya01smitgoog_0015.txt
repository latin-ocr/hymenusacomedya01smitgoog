PREFACE

MY thanks are due to the Librarians of. Gonville

and Caius College and St> John‘s College for
permitting and facilitating my use of the two manu-
scripts of the play. My notes show that 1 have
derived valuable assistance from my friends Mr R. B.
M⁰Kerrow, the editor of Nashe, and Professor Bang
of Louvain, the founder and editor of the Materialien
zur Kunde des cilteren Englischen Dramas. To both of
them 1 return my sincere thanks.

1 have been commissioned by the Syndics of the
University Press to follow up the present publication
with two other Latin plays to be issued in the same

sosoma, viz. ‘Fucus or Histriomastix' acted at Queens’
College in 1623, and ‘Laelia’ acted at the same college
§in the last years of the preceding century.
